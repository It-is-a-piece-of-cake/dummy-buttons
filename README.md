# Dummy-buttons

Dummy-buttons is a simple project where implemented some solutions of buttons 
that usually used in real projects. This is my first experience working with 
React, so please do not don't judge too harshly. 

## Quick Start

  1. Install dependencies
  ```sh
  yarn add yarn
  ```
  2. run the app
  ```sh
    yarn start
  ```
